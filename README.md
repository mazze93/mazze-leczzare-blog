## Deployment

This blog is configured for static deployment to Cloudflare Pages:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Cloudflare Pages
2. Use the following build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory**: `dist`
   - **Root directory**: `/` (default)

The site will be automatically deployed on every push to your main branch.

## Getting Started

To create a similar blog project with Astro:

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

Or clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd mazze-leczzare-blog
npm install
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
